Java-based slot machine game using TMDB actor/film information for matching.

Instead of matching on cherries and lemons and nonsense, these reels pull actors and actress from various modern films and then cross-references their filmographies to see if they've appeared in any films together.

Still very much a WIP.

This game uses the libgdx framework and is written in Java.
